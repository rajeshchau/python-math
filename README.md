# Paint Count App

## Overview
This Python application helps users calculate the amount of paint needed to cover a surface based on its width and height. It simplifies the process of estimating paint requirements for various painting projects.

## Features
- Calculates paint requirements based on width and height input.
- Provides a simple interface for users to input dimensions and obtain paint estimates.
- Supports customization of paint coverage per square unit to accommodate different types of paint and application methods.
